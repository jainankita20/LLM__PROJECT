# Querying CSVs and Plot Graphs with LLMs

Welcome to the project repository for **Querying CSVs and Plot Graphs with LLMs**. This project demonstrates how to perform statistical analysis on CSV files and generate plots using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and integrate with a Language Model (LLM) for generating insights.

## About

This project is developed as an assignment for statistical analysis and data visualization using Python, with integration of a Language Model (LLM) to provide informative responses about the data queried.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Read and parse CSV files
- Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, correlation coefficient)
- Generate various plots (histograms, scatter plots, line plots) based on the data
- Utilize a Language Model (LLM) to answer questions about the data in a comprehensive manner

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Transformers library (for LLM integration)

## Features

- **CSV Data Handling**: Reads and parses CSV files using Pandas.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, scatter plots, and line plots using Matplotlib.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses a Language Model (LLM) to answer questions about the data.
- **User Interaction**: Demonstration of interactive querying and visualization.
